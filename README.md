üéÆ Local multiplayer (2 player) \
üî® Proof-of-concept \
üè´ Made for UW-Whitewater Software Engineering semester project \
‚öõ Used React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, and more!

This project was made for the [COMPSCI 476 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING](https://courses.uww.edu/2241/Undergraduate/COMPSCI/476) class. The assignment itself was to come up with an idea for a software project and build that project over the course of the semester with a small-ish group of five people to develop real-world software development skills like using GitHub, how to work in a team, what tech you might need to know, etc. Our idea was to create a computer game inspired by a board game. We based this "Card battle" game off of the Adventure Time Card Wars idea and attempted to recreate some of the aspects of it in a web app. We used JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Node.js, npm, and more to create the basic web app that is viewable at [jcbhmr.me/card-battle](https://jcbhmr.me/card-battle/).

This app is entirely client-side. There is no server-side component. You can get started easily using ‚ö°StackBlitz by clicking the <kbd>Open in Codeflow</kbd> button above.

- **`npm run dev`:** Runs the Vite dev server so you can see a live reloading preview of your code as you edit it.
- **`npm run format`:** Formats all the code using Prettier. Run this every so often.
- **`npm run build`:** Compiles everything into an `index.html` and associated JavaScript and CSS files. This is what GitHub Actions will run before deploying this site to GitHub Pages.
